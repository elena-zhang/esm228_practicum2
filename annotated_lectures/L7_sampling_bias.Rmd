## Outline & Goals

1. Simulation for statistical reasoning
2. Samples vs. populations
3. Sampling distributions
    - realization vs. expectation
    - standard deviation vs. standard error
4. Sources of sampling bias
    - sample / population mismatch
    - response bias
5. Declaring populations and sampling in code (R)


## Simulation for statistical reasoning

- One of the best ways to gain an intuition about populations, samples, bias, etc. is to simulate data and examine its properties
  + By simulating data, you are also forced to be explicit about the assumptions in your measurement approach
  + By working with simulated data, you also have the chance to try out different approach to analysis
  + This is especially important with *prospective evaluations*, where designs are put forward to collect data before it is available
  
- We're going to simulate data and sampling designs in *R*.

## R Preliminaries

Make sure your R and RStudio are up-to-date. Then install the required packages.

```{r install, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages("DeclareDesign", "ggplot2")
```

Load the required packages.

```{r load, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(DeclareDesign)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
```

## Toy example w/ single item

Carbon footprint of Santa Barbara county households:

  - declare_population() allows you to declare the assumed characteristics of the population that you want to study.

```{r sb-population, echo=TRUE, message=F, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(228) #PH: set.seed() allows you to set the reference point of a random number generator, so that you can replicate the same randomization every time you run the code
population <- declare_population(
  households = add_level(N=36000, 
     tco2e=runif(n=N, min=5, max=120))
) #PH: runif() generates random deviates of a uniform distribution containing N units where the maximum value = max and the minimum value = min.
pop <- population() #PH: population() generates a data.frame() object, containing the columns specified in declare_population(). The data.frame() is named "pop."
plot <- ggplot(pop, aes(x=tco2e)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white")
```

## Toy example w/ single item

```{r sb-population2, echo=FALSE, message=F, eval=TRUE}
plot
```

## Drawing a sample

```{r sb-sample, echo=TRUE, message=F, eval=TRUE}
sam <- sample(1:36000,2000) #PH: sample() is a function from base R that allows you to generate a random sample of X observations over a given range. In this case, we're asking R to randomly sample from a vector of values ranging from 1 to 36000 (1:36000) 2000 times. This produces the "sam" object, which should be 2000 values long with a max<=360000 and a min>=1.
plot2 <- ggplot(pop, aes(x=tco2e)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white") +
  geom_histogram(data=pop[sam,], fill = "black")
```

## Drawing a sample

```{r sb-sample2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=6}
plot2
```

- We're hoping that the sample (black) can say something meaningful about the population (white)

## Samples vs. populations

- *Population*: the complete set of units about which we intend to draw inferences
- *Sample*: the set of units that we are able to collect data about

We work with samples because it is almost never feasible to collect data about all units of interest.

We always evaluate our sampling design with reference to a population.

## Realizations vs. expectations

Let's say we're interested in the mean household carbon footprint in Santa Barbara:

```{r mean-compare}
mean(pop$tco2e)
mean(pop[sam,"tco2e"])
```

Why do these quantities differ?

## Realizations vs. expectations

- Even when we draw a true representative sample, we can expect variation in the sample value across repeated draws.
  + The uncertainty created by *sampling variation* influences the degree to which we can be certain about our conclusions.
  + We typically want to choose sample sizes to keep sampling variation managable, given inferential goals.
  
- When you hear a polling result with a stated *margin of error*, that error is many comprised of expected sampling variation.

- Let's see:

## Sampling distribution

- **Sampling distribution**: the distribution of sample values with a repeated draw of a given sampling frame.
- **Sampling frame**: this procedure describing the sample to be drawn.

```{r sam-dist, cache=TRUE}
sims <- 1000
store <- rep(NA, sims) #PH: in this line, we are creating a "vector" containing 1000 NA values. We use the rep() function to do this. You can read this line of code like: "repeat the value NA 'sims' (1000) times, and store this repeated value as a vector called 'store'."
for (i in 1:sims){
  store[i] <- mean(pop[sample(1:36000,2000),"tco2e"])
} #PH: we've used a for loop to store the mean of a randomly-drawn sample 1000 times. Each pass through the for loop generates an additional draw of the mean, which gets stored as the i-th value in the vector 'store'."
```

##Sampling distribution

```{r plot-sam, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3.5, warning=FALSE}
sam.dist <- ggplot(data.frame(store), aes(x=store)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white") +
  xlab("Mean value of sample") + xlim(c(57,68)) +
  annotate("text",-Inf,Inf,label="n=2000", hjust = 0, vjust = 1)
sam.dist
```

```{r sam-summary}
mean(store) #expected sample mean
sd(store) #standard error
```

## Standard deviation vs. standard error

```{r sd-vs-se}
sd(pop[sam,"tco2e"]) #standard deviation of sample
sd(store) #standard error of sample
```

- *Standard deviation* of a sample describes the variance in the data ($\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}$)
- *Standard error* of a sample describes the expected sampling variance based on the sampling frame over repeated draws

## Standard error and sample size

```{r increase-sam, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.height=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sims <- 1000
store2 <- rep(NA, sims)
for (i in 1:sims){
  store2[i] <- mean(pop[sample(1:36000,4000),"tco2e"]) 
} #PH: in this for loop, we're re-estimating the sample means 1000 times but using a sample of 4000 units. In the lines above, we use a sample of 2000 units to calculate the sample mean.

sam.dist2 <- ggplot(data.frame(store2), aes(x=store2)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white") +
  xlab("Mean value of sample") + xlim(c(57,68)) +
  annotate("text",-Inf,Inf,label="n=4000", hjust = 0, vjust = 1)

grid.arrange(sam.dist,sam.dist2,ncol=1)
```


## Standard error and sample size

```{r samp-dist-many, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
samps <- seq(from=250, to=10000, by=250) #PH: the function seq() creates a vector of numeric values that start at the from= value and go to the to= value, in intervals of by=. You can read this line of code like: "create an object called 'samps' that is a vector of numbers starting from 250 and going to 10000 in steps of 250."
sims <- 1000
store <- rep(NA, sims)
se.store <- rep(NA, length(samps))

for (j in 1:length(samps)){

for (i in 1:sims){
  store[i] <- mean(pop[sample(1:36000,samps[j]),"tco2e"])
}
  
se.store[j] <- sd(store)

} #PH: we use a nested for-loop here because we want to calculate the standard error j-times -- that is, one time for each numeric-value stored in the 'samps' object -- to show how it changes with different sample sizes. The inner for-loop generates a distribution of estimated sample means, and the outer for-loop calculates and stores the standard error.

dta <- data.frame(samps,se.store) %>% mutate(before=ifelse((samps==2000 | samps==4000),1,0)) #PH: in this line, we are telling R to create a data.frame() object with two columns: (1) 'samps' and (2) 'se.store.' Then, we are using the mutate() and ifelse() functions to create a third column called 'before.' Units (or literal cells in the data.frame()) take a value of 1 in this column if their value of sample is equal to 2000 or 40000 -- the '|' operator stands for 'or' -- and take a 0 otherwise. The way to read this line of code is: "create a data.frame() object called dta that contains two columns: 'samps' and 'se.store.' Then, create a third column called 'before.' For each row, if the value of 'samps' is equal to 2000 or 4000, assign a value of 1 to the 'before column; otherwise (else), assign a value of 0.

ggplot(dta, aes(x=samps,y=se.store,color=before)) + geom_point(size=4) + xlab("Sample Size") + ylab("Standard Error of Sample") + theme(legend.position = "none")

```

## Sampling bias

So far we've assumed that we can take a random ("representative") sample from the population and then examined the properties of those samples. In practice, it is often  difficult to take a random sample from our target population, which leads to sampling bias.

- **Sampling bias** is the difference between the true value of the population parameter we are trying to discover and the *expected value* of that parameter based on the sampling procedure.
    + Sampling bias is **not** the difference between the true value of the population parameter and the realized value in a sample.
    + Sampling procedures that deviate from a random sample cause sampling bias.
  
- There are two main sources of sampling bias we will discuss:
    + Population / sample mismatches
    + Reporting bias


## Population / Sample Mismatches

- This occurs when your sampling frame does not match your target population. Some examples:

Population      Sample        
--------        -------------- 
Likely voters   Voters with landline telephones              
Water users     Single family households           
Households      Households on main road
Fishers         Commercial fishers who use certain port
---------       --------------   

- This matters when the outcome covaries with sample frame exclusion criteria


## Mismatches: An Example

![Main road bias](figures/main_road.png)

## Declaring a population: an example

```{r declare-main_road}
set.seed(228)
population <- declare_population(
  households = add_level(N=500, 
     main=draw_binary(N=N, prob = 0.5),
     satisfied=correlate(given = main, rho = 0.5,
                         draw_binary, prob = 0.5)
))
pop <- population()

kable(table(pop$main,pop$satisfied)) %>% 
  add_header_above(c("main"=1,"satisfied"=2))
```

## Consequences of sampling procedures

```{r conseq}
mean(pop$satisfied) #target population parameter
mean(pop %>% filter(main==1) %>% pull(satisfied)) #PH: This line of code calculates the mean of the varaible 'satisfied' from units in the data.frame() 'pop' that have a value of 1 in the 'main' column. 
```

The difference between these two values is **bias**, not sampling variability.

- Look for any part of the population systematically excluded from the sample.
- Change interpretation to match sample actually drawn.


## Population / Sample Mismatches

- Some examples:

Population      Sample        
--------        -------------- 
Likely voters   Voters with landline telephones              
Water users     Single family households           
Households      Households on main road
Fishers         Commercial fishers who use certain port
---------       --------------   


## Response bias

**Response bias** is the difference between the true parameter of interest and the expected sample value of the parameter based on unequal probabilities of reporting.

- Often times harder to address than sample-population mismatches
- Can create large errors in measurement if not managed carefully

Let's continue with the previous example and assume:

1. We now take a random sample of all households by knocking on doors
2. If you live on the main street the chance that you are home is 50%
3. If you live on the side street the chance that you are home is 20%

## Declaring response bias

```{r diff-reporting, size="small"}

reporting <- declare_assignment(blocks=main,
                  assignment_variable = "R",
                  block_prob=c(0.2,0.5)) #PH: here, we are using a function called declare_assignment() from the DeclareDesign package to define how we want R to randomly assign units to being sampled. Instead of using simple or complete random assignment (RA), we are going to use block RA b/c we are assuming that the probabilty of getting sample is conditional on a unit's location (on, off the main road). So, we tell R the name of our blocking variable (blocks=main), the probability of assignment for each block (0.2 for off of the main road and 0.5 for on the main road), and then the name of the new column ("R") that will record whether or not a unit was sampled. 
pop <- reporting(pop)
kable(pop[1:6,])
```

## Declaring response bias

```{r resp-tab}
table(pop$main,pop$R)
```

## Examining sample characteristics

```{r samp-character}

sims <- 1000 #simulations
sam.n <- 250 #attempted sample size

store <- rep(NA, sims)
for (i in 1:sims){
  store[i] <- mean(pop[sample(1:500,sam.n),] %>%
                     filter(R==1) %>%
                     pull(satisfied))
}

summary(store)

```

## Response bias visualization

```{r resp-viz, echo=FALSE}
sam.dist <- ggplot(data.frame(store), aes(x=store)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white") +
  xlab("Mean value of sample") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(pop$satisfied), linetype="dashed", 
                color = "blue", size=1.5)
sam.dist
```

## Common sources of response bias

- Difficulty of reaching certain groups given a sampling procedure
- Convenience samples
- Differential interest in participating
- Different times of availability

Remember both population-sample mismatches and sampling bias can be relevant at the same time


## DeclareDesign()

A flexible framework for making declarations about our population, samples, and diagnosing bias. Let's do what we just did entirely within the DeclareDesign() framework:

```{r declare-pop}
population <- declare_population(
  households = add_level(N=500, 
     main=draw_binary(N=N, prob = 0.5),
     satisfied=correlate(given = main, rho = 0.5,
                         draw_binary, prob = 0.5)
)) #PH: in this line of code, we are declaring the population; or, the units we are studying and the characteristics of those units. For our case, each unit is a household that has three characteristics. (1) The household ID, which is stored in the column 'household'; (2) the location of the household, which is stored in the column 'main'; and (3) the level of satisfaction expressed at each household, which is stored in the column 'satisfied.' 
```

## DeclareDesign()

```{r declare-report}
reporting <- declare_assignment(blocks=main,
                  assignment_variable = "R",
                  block_prob=c(0.2,0.5)) #PH: similar to the example above, we're using this line of code to declare the procedure for random assignment.

sampling <- declare_sampling(n=250) #PH: in this line of code, we're defining the sample size (or, specifically, the number of households we want to include in our sample.)

my_estimand <- declare_estimands(mean(satisfied),
                                 label = "Ybar") #PH: in this line of code, we're defining our estimand; or, the population quanitity of interest that we will try to estimate using our sample. The estimates of this estimand for each household will be stored in a new column called 'Ybar.'

answer <- declare_estimator(satisfied ~ 1,
                            subset = (R==1),
                            model = lm_robust,
                            label = "est.") #PH: we're defining our estimator here; or, the statistical method we'll use to generate estimates of our parameter of interest. In this case, we're going to use the lm_robust() function, with a formula of satisfied ~ 1, to estimate the mean of the satisfaction scores for households that are sampled. These estimates will be stored in a new column called 'est.satisfied.'

```

## DeclareDesign()

```{r diagnosis}
design <- population + reporting + sampling + 
  my_estimand + answer #PH: add all the components of our design together.
diagnosis <- diagnose_design(design)

diagnosis$diagnosands_df[,c(5,11,13,15)] %>%
  kable()

```
